<h1> The Effects of Latitude on Weather <br> (HTML / CSS / Bootstrap Demonstration) </h1>

#### Overview:
The purpose of this project was to create a website that illustrates how weather in a location might be influenced by distance from the equator.
Four aspects of weather were examined: temperature, cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity.
