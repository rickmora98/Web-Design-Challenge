<h1> The Effects of Latitude on Weather <br> (HTML / CSS / Bootstrap Demonstration) </h1>

#### Overview:
The purpose of this project was to create a website that illustrates how weather in a location might be influenced by distance from the equator.
The website was built using HTML, CSS, the Bootstrap library, and static visualizations from a previous project that explored this topic:

#### Folders/Files:
+ **"docs"** (this is the main folder which contains the website source code) <br>
	- *"index.html"* (landing page) <br>
	- *"temp.html"* (temperature analysis page) <br>
	- *"humidity.html"* (humidity analysis page) <br>
	- *"cloudiness.html"* (cloudiness analysis page) <br>
	- *"wind.html"* (wind speed analysis page) <br>
	- *"comparison.html"* (comparison snapshot page) <br>
	- *"data.html"* (data table page) <br>
	- **"css"** (folder containing the style sheets) <br>
	- **"data"** (folder containing the data table) <br>
